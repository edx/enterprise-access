Service to manage access to content for enterprise users.

Setting up enterprise-access
--------------------------

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Set the ``DEVSTACK_WORKSPACE`` env variable (either locally or in your shell config file: ``.bash_rc``, ``.zshrc``, or equivalent) to the folder which contains this repo and the `devstack` repo.
  e.g ``export DEVSTACK_WORKSPACE=/home/<your_user>/edx``
- Set up `devstack <https://github.com/edx/devstack>`_

Quick Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^

::

  $ make docker_build
  $ make dev.provision
  $ make dev.up
  $ make app-shell
  # make requirements
  # make validate  # to run full test suite

The server will run on ``localhost:18270``

Running migrations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

  $ make app-shell
  # python ./manage.py migrate

A note on creating SubsidyRequestCustomerConfiguration Objects locally
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Important note*

In a devstack enviroment, login to the LMS and navigate to any
MFE before creating SubsidyRequestCustomerConfiguration objects in the
enterprise-access Django admin

*Why*

If you create a SubsidyRequestCustomerConfiguration in the Django
admin, because we keep track of who changed the field, we need to grab the
"who" from somewhere. In our case, we use the jwt payload header combined
with the signature, which will be populated in your cookies when you go to an
MFE while logged in. We can't use the edx-jwt-cookie outright because it
won't be set by default when navigating to the django admin.
